            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).</p> 
            <h3>Updated Rules</h3>
            <p>
                In Garden of Life, we've modified the rules to the following:<br>
                1. Any live plant with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
                2. Any live plant with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
                3. Any live plant with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
                4. Any dead plant with exactly three live neighbours becomes a sprout, as if by reproduction.<br>
                5. Any sprout with exactly three live neighbours becomes a flower, as if by reproduction.<br>
